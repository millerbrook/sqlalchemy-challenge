# sqlalchemy-challenge
There are two issues I haven't yet sorted out.
First, in app.py, I get an error on line 149 in the way I'm using except.
Second, in temp_analysis_bonus_2_starter.ipynb, I cannot get the daily_normals function to return values for any dates other than 08-01.

Otherwise, this was a challenging homework assignment from which I learned a great deal. I look forward to working through these problems further.
